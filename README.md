# Python Challenge: Automate Your Day Job with Python

This repo contains scripts and supplementary files for 2 projects:

## 1) PyBank

Analysing the financial records of the company PyBank using a financial dataset stored in a csv file.

## 2) PyRamen
![ramen](ramen.jpg)

Analysing how well a business did on a per-product basis in order to better understand which products are doing well, which are doing poorly and which products may need to be removed or changed.

## Technologies

The scripts are written in Python (with some markdown notes) using Jupyter Lab. These .ipynb file types can be opened and viewed on GitHub without additional software. The .csv files accessed by the scripts are supplied in each project folder. Each script outputs results to a .txt file and an example of each is included.
